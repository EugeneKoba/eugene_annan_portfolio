# My Portfolio Website

A portfolio website that I built, containing information about me, my hobbies/interests & some of the projects that I have been working on. Created with create-react-app – featuring EmailJS, React Intersection-Observer & React Icons.

## Lessons I Learned

This was my first full-scale React Project; beforehand I had completed many smaller React projects. I definitely enjoyed creating this webpage in comparison to my first vanilla javascript website (Jane’s Library Website); simply because of React’s ability to re-use components easily. Just like my last project, I was able to receive feedback from a Senior developers about my code, and have several improvement points that I can partake on.

Here, one of the main things I learned was the sheer difference between a small-scale React project vs a real fully-functioning React Website. I learned the importance of small developer practices, e.g. naming CSS variables correctly & file structure throughout the project; these things are pivotal in the journey of a developer, they can be the difference between an average website & a great website.

## Potential Future Features/Additions

Here are a list of future additions I could potentially add to the website in the near future:

*	SliderJS – I can improve this project by using SliderJS for the ‘Mu Favorite Quotes’ section, to allow the user to scroll through each quote
*	I could have been slightly mpre efficient with CSS code thoughout the project
*	Modal Transitions – there is potential to add a small transition to the open/close modal parts, in the ‘Projects’ section.

## Web Deployment

This website deployed with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
